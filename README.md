# Stock Trend Prediction Web App

• Developed a web application using Streamlit to visualize actual stock price trends over time versus
predicted prices, while incorporating 100-day and 200-day moving averages for a deeper analysis
• Built and trained a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, using Scikit-learn and Keras in python,
for predicting stock prices, using sequential data to improve prediction accuracy
• Designed intuitive, data-driven visualizations with Matplotlib and incorporated interactive trend graphs
into the web app to enhance the user experience
