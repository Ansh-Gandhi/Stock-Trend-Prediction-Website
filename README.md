# Stock Trend Prediction Web App

- Developed a web application using Streamlit to visualize actual stock price trends over time versus predicted prices, while incorporating 100-day and 200-day moving averages for a deeper analysis

- Built and trained a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, using Scikit-learn and Keras in python, for predicting stock prices, using sequential data to improve prediction accuracy

- Designed intuitive, data-driven visualizations with Matplotlib and incorporated interactive trend graphs into the web app to enhance the user experience

To view the web app ensure you have installed python as well as the following libraries:

- sklearn
- keras
- streamlit

Once that is complete, ensure you are in the proper directory in your terminal and type the following command: streamlit run app.py. This will open a new tab in your browser for you to view the app and itneract with it.
